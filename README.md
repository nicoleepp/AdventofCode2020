# AdventofCode2020
My solutions to [Advent of Code 2020](https://adventofcode.com/2020)

### Goals

- Revisiting Python after using [Julia](https://julialang.org/) as my main programming language since 2016.
- Fun
- Learning

### Non-Goals

- Finding optimal solutions
- Refactoring solutions (this is throwaway code only meant for solving the days puzzle)
- Speed

### Personal Guidelines

- Looking up help online is allowed after an initial solution attempt is made and usually only for part 2 (in line with my goal of learning)
- Giving up if a solution takes too long or is no longer fun is also allowed (so there may be missing parts/days)
